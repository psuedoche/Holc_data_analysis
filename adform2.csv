A dozen houses have either been built or aer under construction.  The area is highly restricted and has all utilities.  Although it has prospects of being a highly desirable, exclusive section, several local real estate men believe that sales will be slow largely because of the type of architecture.  These real estate men stated that several prospects condemned the style of houses.  The area will undoubtedly be under developed for the nect few years.  Recently Harry Free, experienced prompter, took charge of the development.  He is trying to interest speculative building contractors in the area.

However, low percent of land improvements and many favorable factors indicate future prospects of better development. Large contiguous tracts of undeveloped land that can be purchased at acreage prices would seem to offer opportunity for speculation and/or resubdividing. That part of this area lying west of Edwards Avenue was seriously handicapped at the time it was subdivided and placed on the market some twelve years ago. The promoters offered a bonus of $50 worth of lumber with each lot, for the purpose of building temporary shelter. In many cases, the resulting shacks have been added to and improved until now there are many very small, poorly designed dwellings, showing little evidence of pride of ownership. Marketability is limited, values are problematical and the majority of residents have little financial responsibility. The area has been further handicapped by the installation of costly street improvements in 1930, which resulted in heavy property assessments and the subsequent loss of many lots and homes. These street improvements resulted in a scandal, involving several city officials. The bonds which were issued in payment, were sold for as little as twenty cents on the dollar and land values sank to the vanishing point. During the depression there were many foreclosures in this area and a large percentage of vacant houses. Recovery has been slow in a large part of the district.

It is still too sparsely settled to predict a definite trend. The area was first put on as a subdivision in 1927 and many building and loan associations placed construction loans here. A number of these loans were foreclosed during the depression period and in consequence, there was an extraordinary drop in values. Some of the more pretentious homes, selling for as little as one-third of their original cost. For these reasons, recovery of values have been slow and halting in comparison with some of the older areas. There is a new highway under construction through the area at the present time and since January 1, 1937, there has been a renewed sales activity here. David D. Bohanon, a speculative builder, has purchased a large number of lots in this area and recently started a program of construction, which comtemplates the building of between three hundred and four hundred, five and six-room homes, the sale price of which will be about $4.50 per square foot, plus the price of the lot, which will average in the neighborhood of $1,000.00. The architecture and type of homes which already have been completed is such that if, as and when, the program is finished, it is possible that that particular portion of the area should be raised to an ""A"" Green grade.
