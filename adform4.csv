The Property Owners Committee in this area must pass on not only the type of construction but also the elgibility of the prospective homeowner. The beach privileges, club house and small park are maintained by direct levy on owners within this subdivision. The most expensive homes (approximately 10) are located on Edgecliff Blvd. and range in value from $15,000 to $18,000. The future for this 75% built up area, with its rigid restrictions and recently strong business building activity, will continue to maintain its high standard of desirability for many years. *Percentages noted for ""occupancy"" and ""owner occupancy"" are based on the fact that this area contains about 100 homes of which 6-8 are new constructions vacant - for sale and about 6 homes tenant-occupied.

In order to present a complete picture, we will take the entire area by footgae and explain its development beginning with E. 226th St. working east to the border of area at E. 265th. East 226th St. was developed in 1928 into lots averaging 50 ft. x 150 ft. at $45-$60 per front foot and is now about 50% developed with homes ranging from $7500-11,000. Fronting lake property (4 homes on Edgewater) range from $13,000-$18,000. Immediately east of this street are the estates of Carmi Thompson, Fred Hein, Chas. R. Ely, Ad Adams, Henry Guenther, Emma Smith and Herbert Gleitz. These properties lie on estate ground running from Lake Shore Blvd. 1400-1600 ft. deep to the lake and consist of 3-17 acre parcels and range in value from $50,000-$200,000.

BROOKWOOD was platted about 1924-25. Utilities and paving installed about 1928. Building was heaviest during 1929. An unusual situation in this area is the fact that expensive homes are intermingled with a few cheap homes (as low as $3000) constructed prior to platting and restrictions now in effect, namely: $6000 on side streets and $10,000 on lake front (exclusive of lot). Average lot is 50 ft. x 170 ft.; all streets improved. The presence of less desirable homes does not appear to detrimentally affect property value since their removal will eventually be accomplished. No additions being permitted. FULLERWOOD was platted about 1928 into lots 50 ft. x 158 ft. All streets have utilities installed. Only 25 homes are located in this beautiful wooded section. Lots originally sold for $60-$75 per front foot. Minimum restriction for homes (exclusive of lot) is $6500. Homes built are much more expensive. Development has been slow in this area due to rather high special assessments which, however, pay out this year. Lthough only 5% built up, the existing restrictions and beautiful appearance of this part of area will, undoubtedly, become a first grade neighborhood when development becomes substantial. HOMESITE was platted about 1924-25 into 40 ft. x 140 ft. restricted to $5000 (house and lot) and has the older homes in this whole area. However, new construction has been better than restrictions but lack of uniformity in set-back has damaged the appearance of some streets, particularly along E. 265th. Location of schools in this area holds property value. Although most homes are frame, new construction is primarily brick. Area is also beautifully wooded. FOREST PARK, a small subdivision, is entirely new and at present consists of 18 homes built last year ranging in price from $6750 to $7950. Construction is excellent; homes are predominantly of brick, gas heated and restrictions are strongly enforced by developer who intends to build 40 more houses on the two new streets being installed south of Shoreview bewteen E. 260th and E. 277th St. Price range of these homes will be from $6500 to $7500. On the whole, this area will maintain its general desirability due to the fact that beach privilaeges and actual home ownership are entirely dependent upon the approval of purchasers by other residents in community. This, in fact, is far more stringent than restrictions on home construction. Rentals are almost non-existent. The one detrimental feature to this neighborhood is its only fair transportation.

Area suffered heavily during the depression, due to its predominancy of factory workers, and foreclosures were heavy. However, with the upturn in business during 1935-36 institutional sales on small down payment basis have been satisfactory. Property values in area have not recovered sharply because of the limited income of prospective purchasers who, through broken employment in such nearby industries as Fisher Body (abutting west boundary), New York Central Railroad Shop, Briggs and Apox Mfg. comapnies and various other industries, has not permitted the accumulation of more than a small down payment which prevents real estate transaction other than by institutions in liquidation. Example: Many of the 600 employees recently recalled to the Collinwoord Railroad shops, from a lay-off since July lived in this section.

At present the whole area is approximately 25% built-up (principally concentrated in the northern part along Glynn and Brewster and the north sides of Wyatt, Fenemore and Henley). This area has all desirable advantages and, with existing minimum building restrictions of $12,500, will continue to maintain its exclusive desirability. However, rapid construction in this area within the next 3 to 5 years is not anticipated due to the fact that Rockefeller interests are favoring the quicker development of the southern part of the allotment lying in Cleveland Heights due to transportation, stores and schools along Mayfield Rd. However, favored schools and their accessibility to this East Cleveland section of Forest Hills will hold all residents.

From 1920 death blows to this area's values were: encircling heavy foreign infiltration into abutting areas, principally Russian-Jewish into section to the northeast; and most important, the almost total migration of wealthy families in this area to the exclusive Shaker Heights subdivision between 1920-30. Then too, original restrictions to residential use on Wade allotments are at expiration point now. Virtually 90% of the original owners of these large homes have moved from this section. This has had a detrimental effect also on the market value of smaller single-family homes which are lcoated in the northerly portion of area. Because of the proximity of these large homes to the college buildings abutting south boundary, many of them have been converted into rooming houses, boarding houses and small educational institutions in themselves, such as: music schools, art schools and fraternity houses. At present it is estimated these fine homes, some costing $300,000, now bring 10¢ or less on the original dollar cost. Exorbitant maintenance prevents ready rental of these large homes but, in many cases, owners have made nominal leases for educational or institutional use. Properties in the northern part abutting the park do not follow in this latter class but because of their obsolescence, size, and large lots have been thrown into this category.

This community has suffered a continued infiltration of foreign and second generation of foreign descent, pushed into this section by colored infiltration to the west (Kinsman-Mt.

Occupancy here began with an extremely heavy infiltration of Russian-Jewish from the downtown 4th grade area around Woodland-55th between the years of 1920-30. The older 4th grade area lying to the west has steadily moved east into this section due to the colored encroachment in that 4th grade area, which also threatens this section although exclusion of Negro occupancy has been restricted to the 4th grade area as shown on map. The cheapness of construction has tended to increase the lack of property maintenance, also partly characteristic of the area. Lots in this area average 40' frontage and are developed about 70%.

Almost immediately the commercial district along Kinsman became solidly Jewish-owned and a heavy infiltration of Russian-Jewish and Italian occurred between 1920-30 and although slower since then has continued up to date. Beginning with about 1928 a movement of colored from the downtown areas started in this section and progressed with moderate success up until about 3 years ago when the movement became more pronounced, and at present is continuing steadily. The heavy slump in price valuation in property in this area occurring following the depression made some recovery up to 1937 with improved general business conditions but is again sliding due to lack of maintenance and constant infiltration from these elements. A boom of commercial property along Kinsman Rd. was experienced in 1928 but collapsed and did not materially affect residential property values. This area throughout shows poor maintenance and rapid depreciation of property is characteristic of these inhabitants. Informed realtor's opinion is that this section should have been, at the outset, developed for colored occupancy as an overflow outlet for the dtrong movement that has progressed into the northeastern part of Cleveland. However no concerted effort was made and the present occupancy has resulted from the normal characteristic of colored infiltration into Jewish & Italian neighborhoods with the obsolescence of property due to lack of maintenance.

Owing to a peculiarity of school district allotment, this section, alothough within the limits of Garfield Heights, sends its children to Cleveland schools and thus pay a school tax of approximately $30 to $40 per property less than the effective Garfield Heights rate. This has enhanced the desirability of the area, particularly for rental tenancy as revealed by the fact that not one rental unit is available at present. Area is free from all normal detrimental influences, except for one odd situation. Colored residents from the distant fourth grade neighborhood to the southeast have acquired the habit of walking through the fields up to and along Christine Ave. in order to avail themselves of the high speed transportation on E. 131st St. This condition has created some sales resistance to properties on that street.

Up until 12 years ago it was almost solidly occupied by Hungarian and Slovak population but with the lessening of industrial activity and lack of upkeep in dwellings, a steady movement of Hungarian families from this neighborhood brought an immediate infiltration of colored from the Outhwaite section lying to the northwest. This infiltration has continued, principally, along Kinsman in the northwestern part of area. At present, property values have virtually reached their maximum depreciation and sales are almost at a standstill except for speculative purposes by owners with purpose of renting to colored in mind for higher rental income. Responsibility for this change was hastened by the electrification of the New York Central RR lines, which in many cases made dead-end streets, and the closing of factories in the depression following '29. The general detriments caused by proximity to industry are all apparent and the lack of upkeep in property will continue to attract colored occupancy. The main thoroughfare for this district is Kinsman Rd. along which commercial property is scattered. The only possible improvement or change from the present rate of colored infiltration would be the renewal of industrial activity which would attract white factory workers back to this area thus creating a market for the sale of heavy institutional holdings.

Homes on Edgewater, Cliff, and Harborview range from $15,000-$25,000 and rent from $100-$125. Properties along Lake Ave. range from $12,000-$18,000 with a rental spread of $75-$90. The south side of Lake Ave., from West Blvd. extending all the way to W. 115th St., is built up with apartments. The rest of the area, however, is restricted to residences and the restrictions have some 20 more years to run. There are approximately 12-15 two-family homes in this area, located on Lake Ave. The area is free from exterior detrimental influences and remains very desirable due to its proximity to Cleveland's Public Square. Although sales are moving slow because of the age and the large type of homes, the area's occupancy continues to be very strong and, in all probability, it will remain so for many years to come. Professional men, especially doctors and attorneys, find this neighborhood desirable because of its nearness to the center of Cleveland. It has excellent transportation and the Edgewater Park bathing beach lies immediately east of this area. Its only handicap is the school situation; there are no junior or senior high schools and the nearest grade school (W. 105th and Baltic), which is located south of the area, stops at the 5th grade and children are compelled to go to the nearest full grade school which is about 1 to 1 1/2 miles away. However, informed realtor's opinion is that school handicap affects only a small portion of occupants (medium income bracket) for the majority of families send their children to private schools.",Cleveland (W. side),2nd,B-16,

Twelve new homes built within past year along W. 226th and W. 227th. Very little development west of municipal limits. Many of the early owners located here, principally, because they could purchase large lots at low cost. As the area developed, several improvements were installed running up the special assessments to a high cost per lot with the result that a good number of the early owners were forced to give up their properties. In addition to these assessments there is a school tax of approximately $12.00 per year. The situation has been somewhat improved through the expiration of some of the special assessments and also because in later years a slightly 'higher-wage-earning class' had settled here.

Terrain is fairly level but residential development is centered mostly in the portion of area immediately south of the railroad yard area; the older cheaper development is along Old Main and Solon Rds. in the railroad yard area. This area suffered a severe setback during the late 20's when the over-allotment and improvement of streets (Bainbridge Rd. sub-div.) placed the community heavily in debt forcing the respread of a $350,000 bonded indebtedness over the whole village. At the present time there are approx. 2900 vacant lots. An additional drawback to this community is the absence of any local source of industrial employment; transportation to Cleveland industrial area (9 mi. distant) is only via combination morning and evening train service. School facilities consist of centralized grade and high school. In the past yrs., Solon has had little or no construction activity within this area but thoroughfares leading out of community have been developed with many cheap constructed small homes (36 in '38) some without basements. Zoning restrictions for the township, however, now prohibit this type of construction. Above mentioned heavy Village indebtedness resulted in many foreclosures. Over 100 of the approx. 400 dwelling structures changed hands between '28-'37 for this reason. Vacancy was also high, being estimated at 7% during '38 but now believed to be only about 3% due to low-rental housing demand in Metropolitan area. This community has had only negligible development except for the period between '18-'28 and due to the aforementioned factors will progress very slowly at best during the next few years.

Some houses are offered at no down payment, but amortized at larger monthly payments until the equivalent of a 10% down payment accrues.

Close to schools and the Plaza business district it is a good rent area. On Walnut at the north end of the district, eight 4-unit apartments were constructed during the last 18 months.

This area was platted in 1922 and, owing to careful and intelligent supervision, development has been more or less constant since. During past few years stimulus of FHA financing has added greatly to activity. A firm of realtors are advertising 100 new FHA dwellings to be built on west side of Alameda St., which will have the effect of enlarging the area.

Population, improvements and maintenance are all highly heterogeneous. Improvements are practically all single-family frame bungalows. Twenty-six of the new improvements are located south of Imperial between Cherry and Yukon and were financed under FHA Title I. There are many Mexican and Japanese farm laborers in adjacent territory, whose children attend the city schools, and this is considered a detrimental influence.

There are still some original owners in the area whose maintenance shows high pride of ownership, but they are rapidly dwindling. Mortgage institutions report a high percent of repossession and losses during the depression period. The area was dormant until the advent of FHA Title II financing, since which time there has been a number of new modern 5 and 6 room dwellings built, largely along Manchester Ave. Old construction was largely of high standard quality but maintenance, except in cases of original ownership, has been only fair. Conversion of large old single-family dwellings to multiples is noticeable, and encroachment of bungalow courts and other income structures is noteworthy. Proximity to Inglewood Park Cemetery, Hollywood Race Track and small oil field, all to the east, and business expansion along Market St. to the west, are all detrimental influences.

Improvements are of somewhat better grade east of Cimarron St., but this is offset by the section’s proximity to industry and business. There is an increasing number of multi-family structures including some bungalow courts scattered throughout the area, and this is thought to indicate the future trend of the district.

This subdivision was placed on the market during the boom period of the early 20’s and lots were sold at high prices. The district suffered severely from foreclosures. However, repossessions sold readily – one institution reports 35 sales during the 1936 and 1937 with none left none left now.

In country territory zoning is inadequate. Regardless of zoning, improvements are 90% single family dwellings. Conveniences are all available in varying degrees. Some street improvements and sewers are lacking in southern portion. This large far flung district varies in age from 25 years or more between Slauson and Florence Avenues to new development from Imperial Highway to Los Angeles County line. There are many old structures scattered throughout which give the area a spotted and heterogeneous aspect. There are many blocks, however, which are uniform as to southwestern part where pattern has not been definitely established. There were many foreclosures in this area during the depression period and the HOLC Veterans’ Welfare Board and other large mortgage institutions at one time owned a large amount of acquirements. These have now, however, been largely liquidated. The area is predominantly workingman’s district and there are numerous duplexes, four family flats and bungalow courts scattered throughout. There is a threat of subversive racial infiltration (Negroes largely) in the southeast portion of area. An attempt was made to break this area down, but it is in a transition period at present, and it was not feasible. However, it is believed that in the course of time it will be necessary that this be done and will result in a number of areas grading from “low blue” to 4th grade. A large amount of FHA financing has recently taken place in the area and has had the effect of greatly increasing home ownership and strengthening its grade. Much of the southwest portion of the area occupies County territory which further confuses the situation. Construction ranges from low to good standard quality. Maintenance is generally fair.

This low income workingman’s district has been under development for the past 12 or 15 years. Growth has been greatly retarded by overlapping Ad valorem tax districts. Much of the area has now been cleared of these but not all. This favorable development, coupled with several large industries moving into the neighborhood and the stimulus of FHA Title I Class 3 and Title II financing, has had the effect of greatly increasing building activity.

Deed restrictions very generally protect against subversive racial hazards and in district east of Otis Ave., north of Tweedy and Abbott Road, regulates improvements and provides uniform “setbacks”. Zoning is mixed but pattern of area is definitely single family residential. Conveniences are all available but transportation is inadequate. Many streets are unimproved and sewers are lacking in outlying sections. This area embraces portions of both Southgate and Lynwood and was developed between 15 and 20 years ago as a workingman’s district. Growth was retarded by overlapping Ad Valorem tax districts but these were largely adjusted during the early part of 1938, and since that time between 300 and 400 homes have been erected, largely through the aid of FHA financing. Construction of older dwellings is more or less substandard, but new construction is generally standard quality. Maintenance is spotted but usually of fair character. Both population and improvements are heterogeneous. The Capital Company recently started to develop a large subdivision between Atlantic Blvd. and Otis Ave., north of Tweedy and Abbott Road. The few improvements completed indicate that this section may in time qualify for a second grade area.

However, this handicap is said to be in process of being overcome. This is the best part of the incorporated town of Southgate, development of which began between 15 and 20 years ago. This area was overburdened with overlapping Ad Valorem tax districts, which retarded development until the bonds were redeemed and an adjustment made in the early part of 1938. Since then building activity, under stimulus of FHA Title II financing, has been very great, particularly in southwest portion, and a complete reversal of trend has taken place. Construction of older dwellings were of only fair standard quality, but current building is of much higher quality. Maintenance is generally of good character. Owing to a wide differential in age and architectural designs, the area has a somewhat heterogeneous aspect. Population is inclined to be homogeneous.

Owing to its very favorable location, when deed restrictions began to expire some 10 years ago, multi-family structures began to appear. The transition from an exclusive single-family neighborhood to a residential income district is proceeding in such an orderly manner and the new structures are so nearly in keeping with the neighborhood that there has been a minimum disturbance of single-family residential values. These multiple housing structures are said to be the most uniform and well-built in the city. The area is surrounded by major arterials upon which outlying business establishments are located.

This area together with “Grand Ave. District” constitutes the old aristocratic residential section of Pasadena and has a nationwide reputation. Many of the structures are 50 years old. Approximately 10% of improvements are of the mansion type occupying from one to five acres and costing in some cases up to $1,000,000. A typical structures of this kind is the 30 to 40 room residence of Phil Wrigley, which occupies the whole block on the west side of Orange Grove Ave. between Arbor and Lockhaven Streets. Many nationally known captains of fiancé and industry maintain homes in this area. During the past several years new arterial shave been constructed which greatly accelerate auto travel to Los Angeles. This has attracted Los Angeles business and professional men to this area and many new 6 to 8 room homes have been constructed. The new improvements have been largely built along Bradford and Bellefontaine Sts. In the southern part of area below Columbia St. Lot values in the area run up to $125 per front foot on Orange Grove Ave. and range from $30 to $50 per front foot in the area as a whole. These prices seem out of proportion compared with lot values in other parts of the city.

This area is part of the old aristocratic residential district of Pasadena, which at one time had a nation-wide reputation. The northwestern part occupies a palisade overlooking the Arroyo Seco. Many structures are 50 years old. Construction is of highest quality and maintenance, while spotted, is generally of a character that minimizes the effect of age and obsolescence. Many original owners still occupy there residences. The Vista del Arroyo Hotel, an all year around resort, occupies the block on the west side of Grand Ave. from Colorado to Ellis St. A number of apartment houses and bungalows are operated in connection with this hotel. The area has been definitely declining for a number of years and is slowly trending to residential income structures.

Except in section directly south of Country Club there are no uniform paving regulations. This is a particularly hard area to grade, particularly the hatched portion. However, Ave. 64 is the new high speed artery from Pasadena to downtown Los Angeles and this factor in itself has led to a stimulation of the neighborhood.

There is a wide spread in age of improvements, old and new dwellings being mixed throughout and in some districts spotted with residential income properties. Obsolescence is observed in most parts of the area. North and west of Occidental College and adjacent to it is a small district of large old dwellings of more imposing character, but age and obsolescence preclude a higher grade than that assigned to the area as a whole. Location, accessibility and proximity to Occidental College are favorable influences.

This is a new subdivision recently placed on the market by the Huntington Land and Improvement Co., who originally purchased it for a short interurban route from Pasadena to Los Angeles. This route was discarded and it lay dormant as a swampy tract until it was included in a WPA project, cleared and drained. (How this was accomplished was not researched). After this improvement the area was platted and placed upon the market as a high grade “commuters” subdivision. Under the stimulus of promotional effort and FHA Title II financing, great progress has been made in its development. Construction runs from standard or better grade. Architectural designs are individually attractive and harmonious as a whole. Population bids fair to be homogeneous. Owing to the convenience of the location to the new Los Angeles City Civic Center the area is a popular one City, County, State and Federal employees. Land values are not stabilized but run from $10 to $15 per front foot. Because of the speculative nature of the enterprise and low ownership equity provided by FHA financing, coupled with the fact that it is engulfed by an old district of lower grade (El Sereto), it is thought that this area has already passed its peak of desirability and is therefore accorded a “high yellow” grade.",Huntington Villa Los Angeles,3rd,C-36,4/11/39

Construction, maintenance and architectural design have been excellent and at present the west and northwest portions are enjoying a considerable building activity. Lot prices are largely governed by topography. Population is homogeneous and imrpovements are harmonious. Construction hazards are the cause of high building costs, but this is somewhat offset by easy financing due to large interest in unimproved property by the Bank of America and by appeal of this type of “near in” seclusive property to certain members of the higher income group.

Conveniences are all readily available, with transportation somewhat inadequate in some sections. Part of area was subdivided over 25 years ago and all of it before 1920. It is one of the oldest parts of Hollywood and was a very popular district at one time. The area is traversed by Highland Ave. and bounded on the east by Cahuenga Blvd. – two heavy traffic arteries – the latter protecting the area from the adverse influence of area D-28 to the east. Construction and maintenance are generally of good quality. Improvements are heterogeneous as to age, size and architectural design. Population, while harmonious, has a wide spread of income, with occupations ranging from better salaried white collar workers to wealthy business and professional men. The topography is uneven and spotted, the central portion is fairy level and balance of area is rolling with steep grades and rugged hills in spots. Proximity to Hollywood Bowl is a detrimental influence. This is an extremely difficult area to grade and there is a wide divergence of opinion among authorities familiar with the district.

While there are comparatively few multiple family structures, the area being preponderantly single family dwellings, the trend is toward that type of improvement. In fact, with lot values around $40 per front foot, construction of 5 and 6 room cottages is hardly practical, even at prevailing high rentals.

This area is one of the older parts of Hollywood proper and was subdivided some 20 years or more ago. It has since been built up with 5, 6 and 7 room dwellings. Since deed restrictions began to expire the trend has been strongly to multiple family dwellings; in fact, single family dwellings in this area are considered an under-improvement. From Sunset Blvd. south to Fountain Ave. between Wilcox Blvd. and Highland Ave. there is a strong Catholic concentration which favorably influences prices and demand in that neighborhood. Proximity to industry on the south and business on the north while decreasing desirability of single family dwellings, has a stimulating effect on land values. Adjacence to the center of the growing radio broadcasting industry has been a favorable factor, particularly upon rentals. Construction is of good quality and maintenance, while somewhat spotted, is generally good. Improvements as a whole are inharmonious.

It is one of the oldest sections of Hollywood and the trend is quite decidedly toward residential income properties. Many sections of the area are entirely built up with 5 and 7 room bungalows which are well constructed and maintained. This is particularly true in the northwest section. Mortgage lenders report an unfavorable lending experience in this district with a number of foreclosures upon which losses were taken. It will be noted that the P.E. Ry. Runs diagonally thru the area and while this adds to transportation conveniences, it is said to be distinctly detrimental so far as sales are concerned.

Proximity to Westwood and Beverly Hills provides conveniently available schools, churches, trading and amusement centers. This area consists of three subdivisions: Bel-Air, Holmby Hills and Beverly Estates, all of which have been developed within the past 15 years in an orderly manner and under efficient sponsorship. This area represents, without question, the highest type of residential construction and maintenance in Los Angeles County. Homesites range in size to from 2 to 15 acres, which sell for from $7500-12500 per acre. Cost pf three recent improvements, including sites in Holmby Hills, were reported to be $80000, $100000, and $110000. It is noticeable that new construction is along conservative lines but represents the highest type of architectural skill. Extensive improvements of less pretentious character, in a price range of $25000-$35000, have taken place in Stone Canyon and tributary valleys in the past 3 years. Sales demand in the area is good.

This area was subdivided about 15 years ago. Early development was not rapid and many of the improvements that period were of questionable construction.

During the past 3 years, under the promotional stimulus of speculative builders and FHA Title II financing, there has been quite a little building activity of much better character. However, the mixed old and new construction gives the area a heterogeneous aspect. There is a high percent of owner occupancy and maintenance indicates pride of ownership. The northern portion, where most of the new construction has taken place, is of better grade and location than the southern part which is adjacent to the Sawtelle Military Cemetery. Although in proximity too many high grade residential districts, the area is colorless and gives promise of becoming a slowly developing area with no particular appeal.

This area, which is composed of Rustic and Santa Monica Canyons, began to develop between 17 and 25 years ago. It has grown like “Topsy” with but little, if any, directional supervision. During past few years a better type of improvement has been noted. Improvements and construction are highly heterogeneous. Maintenance, however, is generally of better quality than might be expected and indicates a pride of occupancy. Population is of mixed character. The average front foot value of lots is around $30. There is a certain charm in the location of this area and the combination of mountain and seashore atmosphere is attractive to many people. There is evidence of an upward trend in the area, which might be termed the renaissance of a beach resort or summer colony neighborhood.

Originally opened up some 14 or 16 years ago as a small “cabin” type project. This area has improved considerably in the past few years and new construction is now more pretentious and of much better quality. In consequence the area is extremely heterogeneous, improvements varying from two-room cabins and shacks to new modern 6 and 7 room bungalows. There are very few improved streets and the majority shown on the map are non-existent and are topographically impossible. Platting has been largely arbitrary, contours being followed as improvements were made. In this respect lack of restrictions has been a decided detriment. Beverly Glen Blvd., the principal thoroughfare, is a through trunk highway, and well-traveled, but is narrow and winding with a number of steep grades. Lot values run from $500 to $650. Realtors state that competition of FHA Title I financing has adversely affected both price and rental values. This area, in common with other canyon developments, faces the hazards of fire, floods and steep grades. Ample forestation, coupled with rustic scenic beauty, lend charm to the neighborhood.

The area north of Pico was formerly zoned in industrial frontage but has been re-zoned and is now approved for FHA policy to mix Title I and Title II construction. The sparseness of development, the general sub-standard quality of construction, particularly among the older improvements, the heterogeneousness of development and the absence of conveniences and adequate transportation preclude other than a medial “C” grade for the area.

This is a typical “company” community, largely owned and control by the Standard Oil Co. of California, which is noted for its employee relation policies.

Originally, dwellings were largely built and owned by the company but, consistent with the policy of encouraging employees to live near its industrial activities, home ownership has gradually increased. The community suffered but little from “depression ills”, nor has it been greatly influenced by past depression building activity, although it is approved territory for FHA financing.

Since the area was cleared of ad valorem bonded debt some two years ago, there has been quite a little activity in the area largely under stimulus of FHA financing and new improvements are of very much better class. In the hatched portion of area are a number of pretentious homes of the country estate type which occupy spacious grounds. In time this area will undoubtedly have to be broken down into a number of smaller areas and regarded. In the meantime it is assigned a “medial” yellow grade.",Tujunga-Sunland District,3rd,C-9,4-3-39

It has considerable elevation and is above fog district, and was first developed some 25 years ago as a resort for those suffering from pulmonary ailments. Recently, under stimulus of FHA financing, many new residences of suburban character have been constructed, but it is still viewed as a “health” section and a number of sanitariums and small cottages for the treatment of tubercular disease are found in the “hatched” portion. Construction ranges from standard to substandard quality and maintenance averages only “fair”. Population and improvements are extremely heterogeneous. This characteristic is even more apparent in the hatched portion of the area where land development averages less than 10% and improvements range from shacks to mansion and estate type structures in the foothills. It is difficult to predict the future desirability of an area of this character; it will probably remain as it is now, a “low yellow” grade.","Montrose, Sparr Hts. and La Crescenta",3rd -,C-14,3-28-39

Many subdivisions are included in this area, all of which are said to have favorable deed restrictions which include protection from racial hazards. Transportation is generally inadequate and is largely dependent upon private conveyance. Buses make schools readily available. Churches and trading centers are generally remote. This large area, which is more like a “countryside” than a residential district, started to develop in the early 20’s. A majority of streets or thoroughfares are paved roads without sidewalks, and there is no sanitary sewerage system. Construction is of standard quality or better and maintenance indicates high pride of ownership. Population although of wide income range is homogeneous. Architectural designs are generally individually attractive. FHA Title II financing has been very stimulating and there is no evidence of high pressure promotional effort. However, indications are that activity will be slower from now on. The northern part of this area south of Fairmount Place and Hacienda Drive along Alta Canada Blvd. is developing rapidly and gives evidence of developing into a first grade area. This whole “countryside” gives evidence of an upward trend and, as a whole, seems to warrant a provisional “high blue” grade.","La Canada, North Chevy Chase, North Flintridge",2nd +,B-26,4-5-39

Deed restrictions provide for minimum improvement cost of $7500, architectural supervision and racial restrictions in perpetuity. Zoning is single family residential. Conveniences are not readily available. This exclusive and sequestered district was subdivided in 1925 and has been slowly developed since that time. A re-subdivision of some of the large acreage plots was recently made with the mutual consent of all property owners of the area. This will undoubtedly stimulate further development as the district is very highly regarded. Construction, architectural designs and maintenance are of the very highest character. It is not practical to designate a predominating type and size or to give price brackets as extent of home sites largely govern prices. In a general way it might be states that estates have cost owners from $25000 to $1000000. The area has been very carefully developed and population is homogeneous, and has a high community pride.

Land improved 60% of possible 85%. Deed restricted in part but provision loosely drawn. Zoning is mostly single-family with multi-family permitted in parts. Availability of conveniences varies with location, from fair to good. Development of this area, which began some 20 years ago, has been irregular, then distinct waves of activity having been experienced, the last of these beginning in 1936 under stimulus of FHA financing, has been the most intense and is still under way. This intermittent activity has resulted in a spotted and more or less inharmonious aspect. New construction is of much better quality than the old, being of standard quality or better. This has had the effect of raising the grade of the whole area. Maintenance indicates pride of occupancy of raising the grade of the whole area. Maintenance indicates pride of occupancy and architectural designs are generally attractive. There are many scatter blocks located near arroyos or below steep hillsides where there are real flood or landslide hazards. However, well-conceived control projects have done much to minimize such dangers and in many cases such hazards are more mental than real. Las Encino’s Canyon properties have suffered most in the past from this menace. The area is an isolated one and, as has been indicated, is inclined to heterogeneity, and this is particularly true of the section west of Canada Blvd. The greatest activity has been in the northern part of the area and it is there that most of the multi-family structures are located. These are built in harmony with other improvements and are not considered subversive. The area as a whole and the surrounding hills are more or less heavily wooded and, while apparently not so considered, seems to offer a very definite fire hazard.

This area has developed from an early beginning as a summer semi-mountain resort and has developed slowly during the past 25 years to a year-round residential neighborhood. Flood hazards were formerly a distinct retardant but, with commencement of a permanent flood control program in 1935, fear of this menace has subsides and remains largely as a mental unfavorable influence. Under the stimulus of FHA financing and its glen-like charm the area has experienced a district upward trend during the past several years. With the background outlined it can be readily seen that improvements, population and maintenance, while greatly improved, are still very heterogeneous in character. Conflicting influences make it extremely difficult to predict the future trend of this area. The heavy rainfall and many floods of last years affected this district adversely. Natural charm and conveniences to Glendale Junior College are favorable influences offsetting to some extent the negative factors indicated. Despite the popularity attained by the area in 1937 it is felt that it reached its peak at that time and that it will experience an off-setting decline which will continue.

The construction of older dwellings is of substandard to “shack” construction.

This contradictory condition is responsible for the wide spread shown above. There is also a wide variance in both price range and maintenance. As a natural sequence of the foregoing, population is heterogeneous. Proximity to the S.P. Ry., Grand Central Airport, and industry to the north and west and business to the south are unfavorable factors. Nearness to employment is a favorable influence and current building activity indicates an upward trend.

This area was subdivided in sections between 1920 and 1923 and some street improvements such as curbs and walks were installed; however, development was begun too late to catch the building boom of that period. Most of the area was subsequently acquired by the building boom of that period. Most of the area was subsequently acquired by the institutions which financed the subdividers, and development was not resumed until the creation of the FHA. With the willing cooperation of the institutional owners and stimulus of FHA Title II financing, speculative builders became active in the area and it has been one of the “hot spots” during the past 2 or 3 years. While the area has been highly promoted, construction, although of the speculative variety, is generally of a good standard grade and maintenance shows pride of ownership. Architectural designs, while not wholly uniform, are attractive. The population while as yet unregimented is inclined to be homogeneous.

There was an abortive attempt to develop this area in 1923 and, while some street improvements were installed and a number of lots sold, few improvements resulted. During the depression most of these subdivisions were taken over by the institutions holding blanket liens against them. Upon the advent of FHA financing this section attracted the attention of speculative builders largely because of low lot prices and favorable terms which could be obtained from institutions, mostly banks, which had acquired and were holding the property. The rapid expansion of the Lockhead and Vega Aircraft which are adjacent to this area, created an abnormal demand for housing and this, coupled with the beginning of FHA Title I financing of small new dwellings, co stimulated construction of dwellings that during the past 12 months it has literally reached boom proportions.

The northeast section is more pretentions than the balance of the area. There are some over-improvements in the section south of Cahuenga Blvd. which gives it a somewhat spotted appearance. This, however, will be largely overcome by reason of the large amount of new construction which is takin place. The area lies in the path of the city growth and while there are some dead-end and unimproved streets, this is to be expected in an area which is in the process of development. The residential lot values run around $20 per front foot, some higher. The trend of residential desirability for the next ten years or more is definitely upward and the area accorded “medial green”.",Hollywood Knolls,1st,A-38,2-24-39

Some construction hazards. Land improved 40%. There are no deed restrictions. Zoning is single-family residential. Conveniences are available but not readily so. Transportation is by bus. Most streets are improved but are generally short dead-end thoroughfares emanating from Linda Vista Avenue. This area was originally a chicken ranch district, and its transition to a residential section began about 1925. Street and other improvements were financed through an issue of Ad valorem Tax Bonds, popularly known as Mattoon District Bonds. This indebtedness in conjunction with the depression retarded development, and it was not until the bond issue was refunded and the advent of the FHA that activity was resumed. Population, improvements, maintenance and architectural designs are all of a heterogeneous character. Many of the old 4 and 5 room ranch type bungalows are still in existence and in spite of many new well-constructed dwellings they give the area a spotted appearance. Distance from conveniences, poor transportation facilities and lack of deed restrictions are also unfavorable factors. Favorable influences are: large number of high grade improvements, rapid increase of better quality inhabitants, and indications of continuance of building activity. While future is somewhat enigmatic, and will not permit of first grade designation at this time, it is believed that progress has been sufficient to warrant a “medial blue” grade.",Linda Vista Pasadena,2nd,B-27,4-4-39

This area is handicapped by inadequate transportation and shopping facilities. Schools are good and readily available and church facilities are adequate. Many dead end and unimproved streets. Sewers are lacking. Water is furnished by a mutual water system belonging to owners of record. This district was originally a section of small lemon and orange groves. In the early 20’s some of these located between Fairoaks and Olive Aves. And Mariposa and Palm Streets were subdivided by Janss Construction Co., who were sold upon a second mortgage basis in a “ballyhoo” campaign. These improvements depreciated very rapidly and have given this particular section a “shopworn” appearance and the whole area a bad reputation. During the past several years, under the stimulus of FHA Title II financing, several subdivisions in the northern part of the area have bene placed upon the market.

This district was originally much smaller but constant infiltration into other sections as deed restrictions expired has created a real menace which is greatly concerning property owners of Pasadena and Altadena. Population, improvements and maintenance are all highly heterogeneous. Many parts of the area zoned for business are honeycombed with single family dwellings, many of them of the “shack” variety, which are occupied by Negroes and other subversive racial elements.

Part of this district was originally subdivided a number of years ago, but was far from successful. During the past 4 years under the stimulus of FHA Title I and Title II financing a number of speculative builders have operated in the area and it has been considered one of the community “hot spots”. Constructive ranges from substandard to standard quality. Architectural designs are individually attractive and usually harmonious as a whole. Population is inclined to be heterogeneous, and while owner occupancy is high, equities average so low as to threaten the economic stability of the area. Practically all improvements are being constructed by speculative builders whose profits are said to be largely derived from arbitrary increase in land prices. Sales are being effected by “high pressure” methods and there is evidence of increasing sales resistance, as many completed dwellings remain unsold. The section east of San Gabriel Blvd. appears to be the most promising part of the area. The section lying north of Chestnut Ave. west of Del Mar St., known as San Gabriel Village, adjoins a low-grade Mexican section and is engulfed by it on three sides and in addition is in proximity to the Pasadena Sewer Farm. This ambitious project is sponsored by Percy Bilton, Inc., which is aid to be financed with English capital. Informed sources very generally consider this a misplaced investment that is doomed to failure. Although most of the improvements are new and fairly well constructed, when the location, character of population, lack of appeal, and large number of completed dwellings remaining unsold are taken into consideration, it is not deemed wise to assign to the are higher than a “medial yellow” grade.",San Gabriel Village and So.

This unincorporated territory is under County government whose zoning ordinances are inadequate. Public transportation is inadequate, shopping centers are distant from parts of area. Schools are good and readily available, and church facilities are convenient. Up to 1905 this area was largely citrus groves, and development began by the purchase of these groves by eastern people for winter homes, who replaced the ranch homes with imposing mansions. This, by and large, is the pattern of the area. Many of the old being super standard. Maintenance, likewise, shows high pride of possession. Architectural designs, as well as landscaping, are individualists and add glamour to the district. This area gives evidence of having been the “melting pot” of the upper income brackets of the nation. This is indicated by the wholesale manner in which indigenous plant life of the various sections of our nation have been injected into the decorative features of those various estates. Horticultural and floricultural novelties of all sections of the nation have been introduced into the decorative scheme of the various holdings. The evergreens of the eastern seaboard and Pacific Northwest are particularly in evidence, and on New Year’s Eve, Santa Anita Avenue is a blaze with an electrical display from these evergreens which border that thoroughfare. There is, however indications of a transition in the area. While many original owners are still residents, properties are more and more passing into control of 2nd and 3rd generation owners. This is definitely suggested by the fact that within the past few years several of these old estates, which for various reasons, have become alienated from original owners, have been subdivided; the old mansions demolished and less pretentious structures and grounds have taken their place. This is particularly obvious in the district between Calaveras and Mariposa Sts. and Santa Anita and El Molino Aves. In this district at least one old estate has been subdivided and 20 new 5 to 7 room bungalows of modern design and extra standard construction have been erected on generous sized lots to take the place of the old improvements. Demolition of another original old mansion was observed in another part of the area. What this portended could not be learned, but there is no doubt that this district is in a transition period. If imagination were allowed full sway, based upon recent developments, a 1st grade might logically be assigned, based upon residential desirability over the next 10 or 15 years. However, the area as a whole gives no such optimistic indication and, based upon present definite prospects, it is thought that all that is justified is a grade of “high yellow” with the suggestion that a future survey will break the area down into several grades.",Altadena,3rd +,C-25,4-6-39

Promotional effort has been particularly directed to young couples who are interested in horseback riding, golf, and other sports. This has been done by capitalizing on the advantages along this line afforded by the facilities in nearby Griffiths Park.

This area is composed of subdivisions known as “Belmont Shores” and “Naples”, both being in the nature of high grade beach resort developments. However, there are an increasing number of permanent residences being built, and the area has been very active during the past 3 or 4 years. Construction is of high standard quality and maintenance is of good character. Architectural designs are generally attractive but undersized lots and irregular platting gives parts of area a crowded aspect. Owing to lack of uniformity in size, lot values are hard to estimate; based upon a 120 ft. depth they will probably range from $25 to $50, probably more for frontages on the Rivo Alto Canal, which are 30 ft. with little depth. In spite of shifting nature population gives the impression of homogeneity. Occupancy is irregular and changes with the seasons; for the same reason rentals are not constant and brackets shown above are only nominal and are upon a yearly lease basis.

This district was subdivided by Los Angeles Investment Co. something over 10 years ago but was very inactive during the depression. Greatest activity has been during the past 3 years due to FHA Title II financing. Construction ranges from standard to super standard quality. Maintenance is of good character. The area consists of a series of hills and valleys, and improvements on the hillside and top are of better grade and more expensive construction than those in the valleys. Hillside lot values are also higher. These factors account for the wide price spread shown above. Desirability shades off from west to east. Adjacent to the green areas to the north and west are favorable influences. Some of the older structures are over 10 years of age and construction is not of as good quality as later improvements. This, and the difference between hill and valley improvements, detracts from the harmonious appearance of the area. Many blocks in the district would qualify for first grade rating but, taken as a whole, the area does not justify higher than a “medial blue” grade.",Inglewood,2nd,B-81,3-14-39

This is a multi-automobile area and is only 5 minutes drive to Hollywood where all conveniences are all readily available. This area was subdivided about 15 years ago and shows its greatest period of development during following 5 years. Since its initial activity growth has largely depended upon the specialized demand of those seeking this particular type of neighborhood. The area is characterized by tis winding paved streets with steep grades and confusing locations. Construction and maintenance, while of excellent quality, is exceedingly expensive owing to excessive costs below the sill lines. Architectural designs are generally pleasing and the area is not without charm. Mortgage institutions limit their financing to high margin loans. Size and topography of individual sites govern lot prices. There is a high percentage of home ownership; however, owing to the very limited market forced sales are likely to be made on a basis far below reproduction costs. It can readily be seen that the future of an area such as described is clouded with doubt and it is felt that while it has many of the characteristics of a first grade area, owing to hazards mentioned and risks involved, it should not be accorded better than a “medial blue” grade.",Hollywoodland,2nd,B-68,2-23-39
